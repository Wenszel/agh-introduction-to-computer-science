Commands for set 1 ("Simple programmes with loops part 1"):
1. Write a program that lists elements of the Fibonacci sequence less than a million.

2. Find the initial expressions instead of 1,1 with the smallest sum,
so that in the sequence analogous to the Fibonacci sequence has a word equal to the number of the current year.

3. Write a program to check if there is a consistent subsequence of the Fibonacci sequence with a given sum.

4. Write a program to calculate the integer root of a natural number using the relation 1 + 3 + 5 + ... = n^2.

5. Write a program to determine the square root using Newton's method.

6. Write a program to solve the equation x^x = 2020 using the Bisection method.

7. Write a program that reads a natural number from the keyboard and answers the question,
whether this number is the product of any two consecutive words of the Fibonacci sequence.

8. Write a program to check whether a given number is prime.

9. Write a program that prints out the divisors of numbers.

10. Write a program that searches for perfect numbers less than one million.

11. Write a program to find amicable numbers smaller than one million.

12. Write a program to determine the greatest common divisor of 3 given numbers.

13. Write a program to determine the smallest common multiple of 3 given numbers

14. Write a programme to calculate the values of cos(x) from the Maclaurin series expansion.

15. The infinite product of:
sqrt(0.5) * sqrt(0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(0.5)) * sqrt(0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(0.5 + 0.5 * sqrt(0.5)))
has the value 2/π. Write a program using this relationship and determining the value of π.

16. Given a sequence defined by the formula: An+1 = (An mod 2) ∗ (3 ∗ An + 1) + (1 - An mod 2) ∗ An/2.
Starting from any natural number > 1, this sequence reaches the value 1.
Write a program that finds a starting word from the interval 2-10000 for which the value 1 is reached after the largest number of steps.

17. Write a program to determine the value to which the quotient of two consecutive expressions of the Fibonacci sequence.
Determine this quotient for different values of the initial expressions of the sequence.

18. Modify Newton's method so that the program from task 5 calculates the root of degree 3.

19. Please write a program to determine the value of the number e using the relationship: e = 1/0! +
1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...

20. The following sequences are given: An+1 = sqrt(An * Bn) and Bn+1 = (An+Bn) / 2.0.
These sequences converge to a common limit called the arithmetic-geometric mean.
Write a program to determine the average arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers.
